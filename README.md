## Welcome to Employee Management System !!
Thank you for checking out the Employee Management System (EMS) project! This application is designed to simplify and streamline employee management tasks for organizations. Whether you're an administrator adding new employees, updating details, or managing records, EMS provides an intuitive and efficient way to handle your workforce data and if you're employee then you can view your data and each employee can download their own payslips as well.

The master branch contains the latest, stable version of the EMS, which includes features such as employee records management, dynamic data display using Thymeleaf, and a secure backend built with Spring Boot, MySQL, and JPA. You can check out the complete details and code there.

We hope you find EMS helpful for your needs, and we encourage you to contribute or report any issues!

Happy managing!
